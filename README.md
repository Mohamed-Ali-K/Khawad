# Khawad
Realization of an input / output module controlled by SMS.
Creating a remote-control card through the SMS Protocol
# Technology used:
  • Siemens MC35i Terminal
  
  • PIC16877A
  
  • Micro pascal pour PIC
  
  • Some electronic knowledge. Choosing the compounds (resistance, condenser relay...) and welding the components
  
  • Proteus (ISIS et ARES) for PCB Simulation and Design
  
# Objective:

  • Remote control of the output states of the card by text message
  
  • Have the user notified in case one of the state changes of one input
